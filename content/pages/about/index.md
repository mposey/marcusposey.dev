Hi! My name is Marcus, and Iâ€™m a sophomore at Cornell University studying computer science. On this blog you'll find occasional musings, both serious and silly, on software development, machine learning, startups, and whatever else comes to mind.

Feel free to reach out to me at [**mep296@cornell.edu**](mailto:mep296@cornell.edu)!
